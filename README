	Gaphor - A UML CASE tool.


Gaphor is rapidly becoming the first really usable CASE tool for GNOME (and
Linux in general).

Gaphor is written in Python, which makes it very easy to use -- and
very easy to extend (and to write ;-).

You can start Gaphor by running the run-gaphor.sh script if your on *nix. Use
the run-gaphor.bat file if your under Windows. 

Note: Before gaphor is built, a config check is done to see if all required
modules are present. This check erquires an X11 environment on *nix. Therefore
make sure you're $DISPLAY variable is set properly before building or
installing Gaphor.

Documentation is stored in a different module: gaphor-doc. It can also be
read on-line on http://gaphor.sourceforge.net/manual.

Have fun,
