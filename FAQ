Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q: I have installed DiaCanvas2 and everything went okay, however when I do a
   "python setup.py config" it complains that it can not find DiaCanvas.

A: There is a good chance the diacanvas-python module is installed correctly,
   but in /usr/local/lib/python2.[23]/site-packages. The easiest solution is
   to add this directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable:

     export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.[23]/site-packages

   As an alternative a setup.py script is provided in the python/ directory
   in the diacanvas2 source distribution.
