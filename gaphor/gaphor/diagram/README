Diagram items

Diagrams typically contain a diacanvas.Canvas. This Canvas contains a bunch of
items. Those items are one way or another related to some UML.Element.

In the UML module a class Presentation is defined. It defines the relation
between one Element and its Presentations.

In the UML module all relations between objects are presented as associations.

There are some conflicts that have to be resolved when using Presentation in
conjunction with diacanvas.CanvasItem:

The default signature of the methods connect() and disconnect() is slightly
different.

This is resolved by overriding connect() and disconnect() and let them act
the same way as UML.Element's.
The unlink() method is added to remove the item from the canvas. This should
be used in stead of disconnecting directly from the parent object.

A __unlink__ signal is added.

Element.presentation connects to '__unlink__' of Presentation.subject.

Note that the subject notifiers are not called during loading, since no
notifications are send during loading.
