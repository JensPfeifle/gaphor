Implementation of connector from Composite Structures and Components.

Actually only assembly connector (see chapter Components in UML
specification) is implemented. This is done with ConnectorItem class.

Assembly Connector
==================
To connect two components with assembly connector
    - first component has to provide at least one interface
    - second one has to require the same interface or its superinterface

Using property pages, user can change
    - the interface - interface is changed on all ends of assembly
      connector
    - superinterface - the interface is changed on given end of assembly
      connector

UML Specificatiom Issues
========================
UML specification is not clear about interfaces as connectable elements
and connector's `kind` attribute.

Current implementation is subject to change in the future, when UML
specification clarifies issues described below.

See also http://www.omg.org/issues/uml2-rtf.open.html#Issue7251

Connector Kind
----------------------------------
Chapter Components of UML specification adds `kind` attribute to connector
metaclass. This is enumeration with two possible values `assembly' and
`delegation'.

It is not clear what value should be assigned to `kind` attribute of
connector, which is defined between connectable elements like ports (not
characterized by interfaces), properties and parameters.

Interfaces as Connectable Elements
----------------------------------
Chapter Composite Structures in UML Superstructure 2.1.2 document does not
specify interfaces as connectable elements.

But definition of assembly connector says:

    An assembly connector is a connector between two components that
    defines that one component provides the services that another component
    requires. An assembly connector is a connector that is defined from
    a required _interface_ or port to a provided _interface_ or port.

Therefore, code of connectors is written with assumption, that interfaces
are connectable elements.
